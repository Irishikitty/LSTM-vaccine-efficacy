## Vaccine LSTM Model

This repository contains an example implementation of a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model for predicting vaccine outcomes using TensorFlow.

### Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- `data/prepare_data.py`: preprocesses the raw data into a format suitable for input into the deep learning model.
- `models/lstm_dropout_mask.py`: defines the model architecture. It is also where the model training process is implemented.
- `models/CHEmodel1.h5`: stores the trained model parameters of the LSTM network.
